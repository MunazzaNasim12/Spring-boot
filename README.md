# Spring Boot Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my personal experiments and practice projects as I learn **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **Spring MVC**.

## 📘 About This Project

This is a hands-on learning repository where I explore:
- 🔹 Building RESTful APIs using Spring Boot
- 🔹 Performing CRUD operations with Spring Data JPA
- 🔹 Structuring projects using Spring MVC pattern
- 🔹 Connecting to databases (like MySQL, H2, etc.)
- 🔹 Practicing best practices in Spring Boot development

## 💡 Why I'm Doing This

I'm passionate about backend development and wanted to dive deep into Spring’s powerful features. This repo tracks my growth, mistakes, and progress.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring MVC
- Maven/Gradle
- H2/MySQL Database

## ✨ What’s Inside

Each directory contains a mini-project or tutorial I've completed. Some may focus on specific features, like JPA repositories or controller mappings.

## 📈 Progress Tracker
